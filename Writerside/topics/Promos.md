## Adding Promos

You can add custom promos by placing a `.promo` file inside <include from="snippets.md" element-id="apath"/>.
The file must contain metadata in
the format `key: value` (space is optional), and newline-separated dialog lines in the
format `"line1","line2",speaker,target(,taunt,demeanor,commands)`.  
Example:

```
title: Test Promo
description: Promo between [P1] and [P2]
characters: 1,2
"Well, well, well, if it isn't $name2.","What brings you here, brother?",1,2
"I came to put an end to your reign of terror, $name1.","And I heard you're touting some newfangled gadget. What is it?",2,1,Point At Ground,-50
"Oh, it's no gadget, brother.","It's the future of wrestling: custom promos.",1,2,Shake Finger,50
"Custom promos? Sounds like a cheap ploy to me.","I'm not falling for it.",2,1,Thumbs Down,-50
"Cheap? Hardly, brother. Custom promos are the real deal. And speaking", "of deals, how about we settle things once and for all in the ring?",1,2
