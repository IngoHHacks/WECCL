Overrides are a way to replace existing content in the game with your own. This is useful for replacing textures, sounds, and music.  
Overrides can be added by placing files into <include from="snippets.md" element-id="opath"/>.
For adding new content, see [Adding Content](Content.md).

## Default Files

A zip file containing all the default files can be found [here](https://ingoh.net/weccl/files/WrestlingEmpire_EditableAssets.zip).  
This folder shows the structure of where to place your overrides and can be used as a reference.  
Note that files from asset bundles should be placed in a folder corresponding to the asset bundle's name. Any other files should be placed in the `resources` folder.
