## Adding Textures
Currently, the only textures that can be added are crowd and sign textures.  
Crowd and sign textures are added by inserting image files into <include from="snippets.md" element-id="apath"/>.  
Crowd textures must be in a subfolder named `crowd` and sign textures must be in a subfolder named `signs`.
Make sure to follow the same layout as the original game's crowd / sign textures to fit in with existing ones. (Signs need to be a 2√ó4 grid of 8 signs)
