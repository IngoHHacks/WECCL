- UPDATE TO GAME VERSION 1.65

### Release 1.9.4
- Added support for new furniture and weapon types that were added in newer versions of the game.

### Release 1.8.4
- Haha, you thought I fixed the case sensitivity issue in the previous release? Well, WRONG! Turns out I only fixed it for 4 out of 6 cases. Now the issue is fixed for real, I hope. 
- Mat Dickie, if you're reading this, remember that it's not 2003 anymore. We have lists now. You don't need to use damn arrays for everything. I'm sure you're a great guy, but please, for the love of god, use lists. I'm begging you.
