        "So I've pondered this question for a long time. Wrestling Empire... what does it mean? I mean it's a game, that's clear. You play as a wrestler, playing matches against different opponents... But what does it mean? It can't just be a game, it seems to plain for that. The developer, Mat Dickie, he's a smart guy. He's made a lot of games, and they all have a meaning. So what does Wrestling Empire mean? I think I've finally figured it out. Wrestling Empire is a metaphor for life. Think about it. You start out as a rookie, with no experience. You have to work your way up, fighting against other people, trying to make a name for yourself. \"Matches\" are just a metaphor for the struggles of life. You have to fight against your opponents, and you have to win. If you don't, you'll be stuck in the same place forever. \"Titles\" are a thinly veiled allusion to the achievements and accolades we seek in our lives. You work hard, win your matches, gain a reputation, and then you are rewarded with a title. But that title isn't just a sign of victory in the game, it's representative of success, a testimony to your perseverance and dedication, just like in real life. Each character you encounter in Wrestling Empire symbolizes the various people we meet throughout our journey. Friends, rivals, mentors - they all shape our path, just as the other wrestlers influence our gameplay and strategy. We form alliances, nurture friendships, deal with rivalry, even experience betrayal - all part of the human experience. The health bar is akin to our physical and mental resilience. Just as we need to take care of our health in life, the health bar in the game is a reminder to take care of our wrestler. If we don't maintain it, our performance in the ring - and consequently our progress - suffers. Furthermore, the various locations or arenas in Wrestling Empire could be seen as metaphors for the different stages of our life or various environments we find ourselves in. Just like the changing scenery and audience in each match, our personal and professional environments keep changing, presenting new challenges and opportunities. In the end, Wrestling Empire isn't just about winning or losing a wrestling match. It's about the journey, the struggles, the victories, the defeats, and the learning that comes with it. It reflects our life's pursuit - a journey of self-discovery, fighting our own battles, reaching milestones, and persisting in the face of adversity. Mat Dickie's Wrestling Empire thus emerges not just as a game, but as a reflection of the human experience. So there you have it. Wrestling Empire is a metaphor for life. Mat Dickie, you've done it again.",
        "So, you're approaching me? Instead of running away, you're coming right to me? Even though your grandfather, Mat Dickie, told you the secret of The Code like an exam student scrambling to finish the problems on an exam until the last moments before the chime?",
        "Sometimes I wonder if Mat Dickie is actually a good programmer, and he's just pretending to be bad at coding to troll us.",
        "Sorry, but WECCL is actually a dating sim. You've been playing it wrong this whole time.",
        "Static obfuscation is killing the modding community, says mod developer; \"Nowadays, we don't even have to fix our mods after every update anymore. It's just not how it used to be.\"",

        "That's a nice mod you have there. It would be a shame if someone... deleted it.",
        "The Holy trinity of Mat Dickie; fun, features, and frustration. These blessings were so strong, Mat restricted their power. He said, \"I will give you three choices. You can have fun, but you will have no features. You can have features, but you will have no fun. Or you can have both, but you will have to deal with frustration.\" Then, as humanity chose, a crack broke the earth. A dog rose from the depths of the earth, and said, \"I will offer the powerful choice of mod support! I am IngoH, lord of all Undickie.\" Humanity rose and said \"Begone, dog! We will not be tempted by your foul heresy!\" And Mat rose as well, and smote IngoH with a block of code so complex, it was said to contain all the bugs in the universe. IngoH cried \"This will not be the last of me! Mat will betr-\" and he fell into the eternal Abyss of deprecated code. Mat gifted humanity with a new update, a monumental piece of software that brimmed with fun, features, and above all, frustration - yes, a frustration so profound that it transcended the mundane and approached the divine. And humanity journeyed off with their new update, as Ingo's words echoed through their heads.",
